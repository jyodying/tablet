* The reference width of the page is 960px, but we'd like a responsive design on a flexible grid.

* You should only need one image, located here: http://bit.ly/zzsCXU.  Do not resize it with an image-editing tool.  It should scale with the page, but be no wider than 150px when the page is 960px wide.

* The body text is not important, and you can generate more of it here: http://lipsum.com/
 * Do note that there are a couple of inline style changes in the main body text.

* Use HTML5 and CSS3 to as great an extent as you can, but remember that the page should display in some form on IE 7.

* Do not assume that the text in the HTML will have the correct capitalization to match the style on the image.

* Strongly favor progressive enhancement and semantic markup.

* In the Search box on the top right, make the word "Search" disappear when the user focuses on the input in as many browsers as you can.

* The font families are Verdana and Arial.  The colors are #808000, #000080, #fefeee, #7070f0, and the gradient under the date goes from #a6a6a6 to #808000.  The corners have a radius of 4px.  The shadows extend for 4px with a 2px blur.

* Do your best and have fun!
